# Overview
This package provides interfaces between Python and SAS. This package enables a Python developer to create mixed Python/SAS workflows to leverage the
powers of both SAS and Python, by connecting a Python process to any of a variety of SAS deployments, where it will run SAS code. The SAS code is
generated by the SASPy object and methods or explicitly user written. Results from SAS are returned as text, HTML5 documents (via SAS ODS), or as
Pandas Data Frames. This package supports running analytics and returning the resulting graphics and result data to the Python process. It can convert
data representations between SAS Data Sets and Pandas Data Frames.

This package has multiple access methods which allow it to connect to local or remote Linux SAS, IOM SAS on Windows, Linux (Including Grid Manager),
or MVS, and local PC SAS. It can run within various Notebooks platforms, or IDE's/UI's or in interactive line mode Python or in Python batch scripts.

It is expected that the user community can, and will, contribute enhancements.

# Installation

This package can be installed via pip, uv, pixi, or conda. This will pull down the latest PyPI package and install it.

## Install with pip

pip is the default Python package manager that comes with Python when downloaded from [python.org](https://www.python.org/)

```
pip install saspy
```

However, if that's too easy, you can also download a specific release from
[SASpy project releases page](https://github.com/sassoftware/saspy/releases), or just clone
the repo and and instll from that. To install a given release, use the following,
where the X.X.X is the release version you want.

```
pip install https://github.com/sassoftware/saspy/archive/vX.X.X.tar.gz
```

## Install with uv

[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) Is a Python package and project manager, written in Rust.

```
uv init name-of-project
cd name-of-project
uv add saspy # adds saspy to your project from PyPI
```

Installing a specific release can be done from the [SASpy project releases page](https://github.com/sassoftware/saspy/releases), where the X.X.X is the release version you want.

```
uv init name-of-project
cd name-of-project
uv add https://github.com/sassoftware/saspy/archive/vX.X.X.tar.gz
```

## Install via pixi

[pixi](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi) is a language-agnostic and cross-platform package management tool built on the foundation of the conda ecosystem. You can install packages from the [conda-forge channel](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/saspy), or PyPI.

```
pixi init name-of-project
pixi cd name-of-project
pixi add saspy # Installs latest version from conda-forge channel by default.
pixi add saspy==X.X.X # Where X.X.X is the version you'd like to install.

# If you'd like to install saspy from PyPI.
pixi add python # Python is a required dependency for packages installed from PyPI.
pixi add --pypi saspy # Installs latest version from PyPI.
pixi add --pypi saspy==X.X.X # Where X.X.X is the version you'd like to install.
```

## Install via conda

[conda](https://github.com/conda/conda) is a cross-platform, language-agnostic binary package manager.

```
conda create --name name-of-my-environment
conda install --channel conda-forge saspy # Installs latest version of saspy from conda-forge channel.
conda install --channel conda-forge saspy==X.X.X # Where X.X.X is the version you'd like to install.
```
